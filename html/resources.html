        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp; In Iceland, there are many rescourcses in relation to mental health issues. The following list is incompleteinexhaustive, but the focus was put on listing most of the rescourcses that individuals can look for themselves without a referral from a health care professional. Therefore, many rescourcses are not listed here as individuals need to be referred to receive them, such as psychiatric wards within hospitals. References to such rescourcses often come from health care, and more information about health care centres clinics can be found below.</p> <br>  
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Keep in mind that sometimes a therapist or therapy rescourcses are not suitable for the individual, but it is important not to give up but rather to continue looking elsewhere.</p>

                    <p>To get assistance with psychological problems at the clinic, you need to make an appointment with a doctor. Physicians learn a lot about psychological problems as part of their special education. A physician may prescribe psychotropic drugs if they deem it necessary, and physicians may refer cases to psychologists within the facility. In addition, physicians and psychologists in a health care clinic can make referrals to numerous parties and institutions such as psychiatrists, psychologists, hospital wards, VIRK rehabilitation, home nursing, mental health teams and more. The mental health services of the health care clinic vary and differs depending on which clinic is involved.
