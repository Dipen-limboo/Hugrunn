She shares how she became addicted to having complete control over her own body which led to depression and anxiety. Today, she is recovering and says that with a good relationship with her weak side, she got to where she is today.</p>

            <p>"Ever since I can remember, I've wanted to be an actress. I always had a bit of a devil's tantrum and preferred to play the weird character in the school plays: Icicle or Santa Claus. After I graduated from the Business School, I was offered a job at the City Theater where I assisted in the production of The Wizard of Oz. I had enrolled in biochemistry because I felt I needed another plan just in case. After I started working at the City Theatre, I knew there was no going back. I was just satisfied that I had supported UI by 40,000 ISK that year with the enrollment fees."</p>

            <h2>The anarchy created a perfectionism</h2>
            <p>Vala grew up in Garðabær with her family and spent her entire elementary school years there. "I was kind of A-type, always got top grades and did everything to do well. At the time, a close relative was suffering from alcoholism and was diagnosed with a mental illness when he was drinking. I didn't realize until later that this created a difficult family pattern at home. My family are great people, but in a situation like this, there is so much co-operation and control. Each member takes on some role in the sick state. I took on the role of savior."</p>
            <div class="campaing-content-image campaign-content-img campaignImg">

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>"Trying to control the situation for years creates a lot of anxiety. With so much anarchy in my life, I decided to do everything I could to control what I could. That's when I started getting sick. I've never purposely thrown up in my life and never gone a whole day without eating, but I developed a perfectionism about food and fitness."</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>"Each member takes on a role in the sick state. I took on the role of savior."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>“I became addicted to the feeling of seeing tangible results on my body. I felt complete control and that feeling was like intoxication. But then it started working against me. The party ended and suddenly I couldn't engage in conversation if there was a bowl of candy on the table. I got so busy staying away from the candy that I wasn't present for the conversation. What happens when the body is undernourished is that the emotional center in the brain goes numb and you feel much less emotion. It's chemical, if there's something difficult going on around you, it's normal to just want to stop feeling."</p>

            <h2>An eating disorder is a controlling addiction</h2>
            <p>However, it wasn't until after Vala went through her first breakup that she decided to seek help.</p>
            <p>"When you're in close relationships, it's hard to hide the poison that lives inside you. I couldn't accept love because I had lost interest in myself. It began to undermine intimacy and the ability to be free in love. I started experiencing a lot of anxiety and depression and suddenly I gave up, picked up the phone and asked BUGL: What do I do if I think I have an eating disorder?'</p>
            <p>We took two years of work with a psychologist who dealt with the eating disorder like an addiction. "Eating disorders are really a control addiction. I hid it from family and friends, obsessing over the subject, experiencing shame and self-loathing. After all this work, I came out just as confused, but since then the pieces have been coming together."</p>

        <h2>Adult Vala takes care of little Vala</h2>
        <p>When Vala is asked how she feels today, she says that, as with anyone with an addiction disease, she is never cured, but she is in constant recovery.</p>
        <p>"When I face certain situations, if I'm rejected or if I'm not doing well at work, these ideas are triggered. "We definitely felt a little better now if we just went to the gym twice as much. This desire to control the situation.”</p>
        <p>"But I'm not in a bad relationship with that side of me." I just need to speak out loud as if there are two of us, little Vala is having a conversation with adult Vala. Then adult Vala has to listen to little Vala who is hurt. Take care of her and say, "Okay, you're feeling bad right now and I understand that, but I'm an adult so I can take care of both of us." Like I'm talking to my little niece. And what would I do for her? Go to mom and dad's for dinner, go swimming or buy something beautiful. All these little things make so much difference. To have a good time with herself."</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>"I was doing everything I could, but there was still a chemical imbalance in me." And the drugs lifted me above zero."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>"The recovery process takes time and it takes but it's worth it. Now I'm present in my life, with my friends in some kind of laughter or at work creating. I don't have food, fitness or my body on my mind. It's the greatest freedom I've ever experienced."</p>

    <section id="campaign-content-II">
        <h2>The drugs lifted me above zero</h2>
        <p>A little over a year ago, Vala had made a big recovery, but after all this self-work, she was still experiencing anxiety, depression and obsession. One night, out of the blue, she called her dad crying and asked which psychiatrist she should see.</p>
        <p>"My parents had suggested it years ago but I resisted." I was so prejudiced and was afraid of being labeled insane. But when I got an appointment with my psychiatrist, nothing but wonderfulness took over. He saw that I had done everything I could. Exercise, eat regularly and healthy, work hard on myself. All by the book. I was given mild anti-anxiety and anti-depressants. That was the final point in my recovery. It has saved my life. "</p>
        <p>"I was doing everything I could, but there was still a chemical imbalance in me." And the drugs lifted me above zero."</p>
        <div class="campaing-content-image campaign-content-img campaignImg">
            <p><img src="../../images/testimonials/img_8.jpg    " alt="#"></p>
        </div>
        <p>"It's also about the fact that sometimes you need help that isn't about getting better or going to yoga. I do, even though it makes me uncomfortable, to talk openly about my psychiatrist or my medication. I try as hard as I can not to hide this. These issues must be on the table as much as other health issues. The game of hide and seek perpetuates shame which is like oil on fire mixed with mental illness. Shame does not survive the sunlight."</p>
    </section>
    <section id="campaign-content-II">
            <h2>The body's internal clock</h2>
            <p>"There are so many people in this situation and there are lots of resources. I was afraid to go into recovery because I had calculated in my head that if I relaxed the rope I would start gaining weight and then I would just keep gaining weight the infinite. I would just end up with an obesity problem. And of two evils, I thought it would be better to be too thin. But when I learn to listen to myself, eat when I'm hungry and stop when I'm full, my body finds my ideal weight. I don't have to control everything. We have this amazing body with an internal clock."</p>
            <p>"If there's anyone reading this and thinking, 'Oh my God, I don't want to gain five pounds.'" The freedom that comes with being in recovery from this is just priceless, and five pounds will be gone. I can't even describe how insignificant that is compared to all the good things you get from being in recovery."</p>
            <p>The interviewees appeared in the interviews on their own terms. The interview is based on their experiences. It is worth mentioning that experiences are personal and not everyone experiences the same symptoms.</p>
            <p>Hugrún would also like to point out the resources that are available to those who believe they are experiencing the symptoms of an eating disorder here .</p>
